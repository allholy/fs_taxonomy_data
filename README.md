# A Simple and Broad Taxonomy 

This repository contains information about a simple taxonomy for the classification of a broad range of sounds, suitable for large and diverse libraries.
This taxonomy enables the organization of sounds into a hierarchical structure consisting of two levels, including a total of 29 sound classes.
There are 5 top-level categories representing broad classes, and a second level with 24 total categories hat capture more nuanced distinctions within each class.


## Additional data

In this [file](taxonomy.csv) (coming soon..), we present the taxonomy by giving a brief description and examples for every subclass.

[Here](design-criteria.csv) (coming soon..) you can find the scores of our design-criteria according to our design criteria.
