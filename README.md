# A Simple and Broad Taxonomy 
This repository contains information about a simple taxonomy for the classification of a broad range of sounds, suitable for large and diverse libraries.
This taxonomy enables the organization of sounds into a hierarchical structure consisting of two levels, including a total of 29 sound classes.
There are 5 top-level categories representing broad classes, and a second level with 24 total categories hat capture more nuanced distinctions within each class.
